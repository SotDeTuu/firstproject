            <p>A car, also known as an automobile, is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most cars are designed to run primarily on roads, have four wheels, and typically accommodate one to eight people. Modern cars are powered by internal combustion engines or electric motors and are a fundamental part of daily transportation worldwide.</p>
            <div><h2>Evolution of Cars</h2></div>
            

<p>The history of cars dates back to the late 19th century when inventors began developing self-propelled vehicles. The first practical automobile is credited to Karl Benz, who built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1885. Early cars were powered by steam or electricity, but gasoline-powered internal combustion engines became the dominant technology by the early 20th century.

The mass production of automobiles was revolutionized by Henry Ford with the introduction of the assembly line in 1913. This innovation made cars more affordable and accessible to the general public. Over time, advancements in engineering, safety features, and fuel efficiency led to the modern vehicles seen today.

In recent decades, there has been a shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles due to concerns about environmental pollution and fuel consumption. Companies like Tesla, Toyota, and other major automakers have developed electric and hybrid models that aim to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
